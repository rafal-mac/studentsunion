        <h2 class="title">Typical Week</h2>
        <p align="justify">A computer science students' typical week at university often involves several trips to the Students' Union,
        whether it's between lectures or for late night parties.  It's the perfect spot to unwind and relax, perhaps,
        over a cup of coffee at Coffee Revolution or a slice of pizza at Uni Central given its close proximity to the
        Diamond where we usually have most of our lectures.

        <p>If you need to, you can also use a lot of its spaces to work
        on projects, or assignments with your coursemates. A lot of computer scientists often like to relax not only by
        listening to but also by playing music, which is also possible in Students' Union. There is a special music room
        available to book for your private jam sessions. Also when it comes to movie lovers, the Film Unit has their own
        cinema in the Nelson Mandela Auditorium right below the Coffee Revolution, where they have screenings of a lot of
        the film premieres almost every day of the week.</p>

        <p>Another good spot for relaxing and enjoying your evenings would
        be Bar One where you can enjoy a nice pint over a game of pool. On Thursdays, they also organize karaokes, which
        gives your inner pop star a chance to shine. You get quite a few chances during the week to party at Students' Union,
        especially in the Foundry with Wednesday's Roar and Saturday's Pop Tarts parties.</p>

        <p>Don't worry if you happen to lose your U-Card, you can always visit SSID and get a new one for 5 pounds. Another helpful place you might want to visit
        is the Jobshop, especially if you're a second year student looking for a placement. Overall, the SU has a lot to
        offer as long as you are willing to actually go there :)</p>
